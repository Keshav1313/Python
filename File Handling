#Creation of new file under write mode.

text_file=open('text.txt','w')
text_file.write('Hi my name is Keshav Sinha.')
text_file.close()

text_file=open('text.txt','a')
text_file.write('Hi my name is Keshav Sinha.')
text_file.close()

OUTPUT:
Go and check the file where it is saved .
The line write in code get added.


If we want rename file or remove file then we have to use OS MODULE:

import os
os.rename(r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\text.txt',r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\keshav.txt')

import os
os.remove(r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\keshav.txt')



import os
os.mkdir(r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Newfolder')
>>> import os
>>> os.getcwd()
'C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36'
>>> import os
>>> os.chdir(r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Newfolder')
>>> import os
>>> os.getcwd()
'C:\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\Newfolder'
>>> import os
>>> os.mkdir('keshav')

>>> import os
>>> os.chdir('C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36')
>>> import os
>>> os.getcwd()
'C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36'
>>> import os
>>> os.listdir()
['DLLs', 'Doc', 'etc', 'include', 'Lib', 'libs', 'LICENSE.txt',
'myfile.txt', 'NEWS.txt', 'openfunc.py', 'python.exe', 'python3.dll', 
'python36.dll', 'pythonw.exe', 'readingtext.py', 'README.txt', 'Scripts', 'share',
'tcl', 'Tools', 'vcruntime140.dll']

>>> os.chdir(r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Newfolder')
>>> os.rmdir('keshav')


file=open(r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\keshav.txt','w')
file.write('Hello world')
file.close()


file=open(r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\keshav.txt','r')
print('File Name:',file.name)
print('File MOde:',file.mode)
print('Is file Readable:',file.readable())
print("Is File Writable: ",file.writable())
print("Is File Closed : ",file.closed)
file.close()
print('Is file closed:',file.closed)


OUTPUT:
File Name: C:\Users\HP\Desktop\keshav.txt
File MOde: r
Is file Readable: True
Is File Writable:  False
Is File Closed :  False
Is file closed: True


f=open(r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\keshav.txt','w')
f.write('Keshav\n')
f.write('Learning\n')
f.write('Python\n')
print('Data written to the file Successfully.')

OUTPUT:
Data written to the file Successfully.


###--------APPEND MODE--------------------------------

f=open(r'C:\Users\HP\Desktop\keshav.txt','a')
list=["sunny\n","bunny\n","vinny\n","chinny"]
f.writelines(list)
print('List of line written to the file successfully.')

OUTPUT:
List of line written to the file successfully.

__________________________________NOTES_________________________________________________
As the part of programming requirement, we have to store our data permanently for
future purpose. For this requirement we should go for files.
Files are very common permanent storage areas to store our data.
Types of Files:
There are 2 types of files
1. Text Files:
Usually we can use text files to store character data
eg: abc.txt
2. Binary Files:
Usually we can use binary files to store binary data like images,video files, audio files etc...
Opening a File:
Before performing any operation (like read or write) on the file,first we have to open that
file.For this we should use Python's inbuilt function open()
But at the time of open, we have to specify mode,which represents the purpose of
opening file.
f = open(filename, mode)


The allowed modes in Python are

1. r  open an existing file for read operation. The file pointer is positioned at the
beginning of the file.If the specified file does not exist then we will get
FileNotFoundError.This is default mode.

2. w  open an existing file for write operation. If the file already contains some data
then it will be overridden. If the specified file is not already avaialble then this mode will
create that file.

3. a  open an existing file for append operation. It won't override existing data.If the
specified file is not already avaialble then this mode will create a new file.

4. r+  To read and write data into the file. The previous data in the file will not be
deleted.The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.

5. w+  To write and read data. It will override existing data.

6. a+  To append and read data from the file.It wont override existing data.

7. x  To open a file in exclusive creation mode for write operation. If the file already
exists then we will get FileExistsError.

Note: All the above modes are applicable for text files. If the above modes suffixed with
'b' then these represents for binary files.

Eg: rb,wb,ab,r+b,w+b,a+b,xb
