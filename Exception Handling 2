In any programming language there are 2 types of errors are possible.
1. Syntax Errors
2. Runtime Errors

1. Syntax Errors:
The errors which occurs because of invalid syntax are called syntax errors.
Eg 1:
x=10
if x==10
print("keshav")
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Eg 2:
print "keshav"
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
Note:
Programmer is responsible to correct these syntax errors. Once all syntax errors are
corrected then only program execution will be started.


2. Runtime Errors:
Also known as exceptions.
While executing the program if something goes wrong because of end user input or
programming logic or memory problems etc then we will get Runtime Errors.
Eg: print(10/0) ==>ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
print(10/"ten") ==>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'
x=int(input("Enter Number:"))
print(x)
D:\Python_classes>py test.py

Enter Number:ten
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'ten'


Note: Exception Handling concept applicable for Runtime Errors but not for syntax errors


--------------------------------------------Exception Handling -----------------------------------------------------------

What is Exception:
An unwanted and unexpected event that disturbs normal flow of program is called exception.

Eg:
ZeroDivisionError
TypeError
ValueError
FileNotFoundError
EOFError
SleepingError
TyrePuncturedError


Eg:
For example our programming requirement is reading data from remote file locating at
London. At runtime if london file is not available then the program should not be
terminated abnormally. We have to provide local file to continue rest of the program
normally. This way of defining alternative is nothing but exception handling.

try:
    x=int(input('Enter the value of x :'))
    y=int(input('Enter the value of y :'))
    print(x/y)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print('Cant Divivde with Zero')
except ValueError:
    print('please provide integer Value Only.')
    
    
OUTPUT:

Enter the value of x :10
Enter the value of y :5
2.0

Enter the value of x :10
Enter the value of y :0
Cant Divivde with Zero

Enter the value of x :10
Enter the value of y :ten
please provide integer Value Only.

Enter the value of x :10
Enter the value of y :-10
-1.0
