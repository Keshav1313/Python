In any programming language there are 2 types of errors are possible.
1. Syntax Errors
2. Runtime Errors

1. Syntax Errors:
The errors which occurs because of invalid syntax are called syntax errors.
Eg 1:
x=10
if x==10
print("Hello")
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Eg 2:
print "Hello"
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
Note:
Programmer is responsible to correct these syntax errors. Once all syntax errors are
corrected then only program execution will be started.
